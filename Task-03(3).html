            <p>Many APIs have moved toward supporting GraphQL in addition to REST or even supporting it exclusively. However, if you need to consume a GraphQL API, you wouldn't be blamed for thinking that you must use a JavaScript framework such as React or several additional libraries just to get it to work. That's because many tutorials and sample code seem to work off of the assumption that, if you're working with GraphQL, you are working with these libraries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <p>However, a query to a GraphQL API is just a properly formatted HTTP request. A GraphQL response is just JSON. You don't need any fancy libraries to handle either of these. In this tutorial, take a look at a different approach, and learn how easy it is to call a GraphQL API from both Node and client-side JavaScript without libraries..</p>

        <div class="box">
            <p>query is required and contains (you guessed it) the GraphQL query. Because GraphQL functions through a single endpoint, the data that the endpoint responds with is entirely dependent upon your query. The query must be properly formatted GraphQL..</p>

            <p>variables is optional and is a JSON object that contains the value of any variables being passed to your query. For example, if your query requires a variable of id (which appears in the query as $id), then you must send variables as the following.</p>

            <p>In the following example, you need to replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_API_KEY with your credentials from API Connect Essentials.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <p> This response returns a list of posts from the GraphQL API. Again, this data is just JSON, so if you were to run this, the output in the console would be something like the following code.</p>
